# Welcome to Redemption!

[![Build Status](https://github.com/RedemptionEngine/redemption/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RedemptionEngine/redemption/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22)

## Redemption is a modder-friendly fork of GZDoom that seeks to take its own route, setting certain defaults to what is more modern or standard, and even implementing features that previously have been non-negotiable. The end goal of all this is to make an engine that focuses on the User Experience, to try and take what is essentially a 1990's program and make it work for today's audience.
