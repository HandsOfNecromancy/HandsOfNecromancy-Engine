# Welcome to Redemption!

## Redemption is a modder-friendly fork of GZDoom that seeks to take its own route, setting certain defaults to what is more modern or standard, and even implementing features that previously have been non-negotiable. The end goal of all this is to make an engine that focuses on the User Experience, to try and take what is essentially a 1990's program and make it work for today's audience.
