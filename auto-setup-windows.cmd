** auto-setup-windows.cmd
** Automatic (easy) setup and build script for Windows
**
** Note that this script assumes you have both 'git' and 'cmake' installed properly and in your PATH!
** This script also assumes you have installed a build system that cmake can automatically detect.
** Such as Visual Studio Community. Requires appropriate SDK installed too!
** Without these items, this script will FAIL! So make sure you have your build environment properly
** set up in order for this script to succeed.
**
** The purpose of this script is to get someone easily going with a full working compile of GZDoom.
** This allows anyone to make simple changes or tweaks to the engine as they see fit and easily
** compile their own copy without having to follow complex instructions to get it working.
** Every build environment is different, and every computer system is different - this should work
** in most typical systems under Windows but it may fail under certain types of systems or conditions.
** Not guaranteed to work and your mileage will vary.
