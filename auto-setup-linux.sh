#** auto-setup-linux.sh
#** Automatic (easy) setup and build script for Linux
#**
#** Note that this script assumes you have both 'git' and 'cmake' installed properly and in your PATH!
#** This script also assumes you have installed a build system that cmake can automatically detect.
#** Such as GCC or Clang. Requires appropriate supporting libraries installed too!
#** Without these items, this script will FAIL! So make sure you have your build environment properly
#** set up in order for this script to succeed.
#**
#** The purpose of this script is to get someone easily going with a full working compile of GZDoom.
#** This allows anyone to make simple changes or tweaks to the engine as they see fit and easily
#** compile their own copy without having to follow complex instructions to get it working.
#** Every build environment is different, and every computer system is different - this should work
#** in most typical systems under Windows but it may fail under certain types of systems or conditions.
#** Not guaranteed to work and your mileage will vary.
#**
#** Prerequisite Packages used in testing (from Linux Mint-XFCE):
#**    nasm autoconf libtool libsystemd-dev clang-15 libx11-dev libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev
